Example only uses the Robot.java file for declaring, initializing, and programming the motors. Includes example code for NON-functioning SparkMaxs and Digitial Input Sensor.

List of knowns:
Control the Motors which are coupled together in order (groups of 2) for the them to function in six-wheel drive system. Since 2 of the 4 motors are facing the wrong direction, we need to flip them. We need to write code for the X-box controller so we have a platform to control the robot from. 

To Do: 
Start by Declaring all the motors, speed controllers, and other controllers (X-box controller)


TBD: Auton routines
